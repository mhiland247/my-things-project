                    I am a Colorado native and growing up in a mountain town I learned about balancing an economy based on tourism with a high quality of life for residents. Estes Park has been my home for the past 5 years and I love adventuring daily in the RMNP. Some of my favorite activities are running up Longs Peak, ice skating Sky Pond, finding powder in Hidden Valley or taking an excursion on my cross country skis or mountain bike.

                    I graduated from the University of Colorado in Boulder with two degrees, one in Business and one in Integrated Physiology (Kinesiology). I currently work for an endurance training software company where I create the strategy and implementation of our marketing and communication to athletes and coaches all over the world.

                        <p>
						Over the last several years, I have watched and listened to well intentioned citizens from our town raise their voices over and over again, only to be ignored. Many times the people were not even notified or informed about something right in their backyard until the last minute. I have listened to them make their grievances with a hope that their public comment at the town board meetings would make a difference. Unfortunately the outcome was the same every time, either they were too late or their concerns weren’t enough. When the people are continually ignored by those elected to represent them then the system is failing.

                        <h3>Our Economy is Unsustainable</h3>
                        <p>
			Over 30 of the people I have shared life with in our town have left Estes Park in just the past 2 years alone. These residents were a mix of people that represent each of us today. They were working families with children, young couples with professional jobs who desired a greater feeling of community, single young adults who hit a ceiling in the service industry, retired couples who volunteered in our town, middle aged adults who couldn’t advance in their jobs, teachers, and single moms. The list goes on and it doesn’t stop with locals, our visitors are also leaving disgruntled and less likely to return. Each individual story speaks loudly to a different problem with the economy of Estes Park and if we don’t address these needs we will continue to lose more people.

						The people must be heard and they must know they matter. I will listen to everyone in our community and I will take action. I will work hard to ensure there is communication far in advance, so that people have time to express their concerns and make an impact before it is too late. I will work hard to make sure the Comprehensive Plan and Development Code are able to protect the community from predatory developments. My skills in business administration and operations will allow me to find the best solutions for the concerns brought up by the people.

			  I will work to create a sustainable economy that can attract and retain residents and visitors. We must move forward with a town board that can proactively lead while partnering with other organizations in town. We need childcare for working families, places for the community to gather, sustainable affordable housing solutions, support for our seniors, more professional jobs, a greater variety of businesses and offerings, and a better visitor experience. I will work to create a childcare action plan that addresses capacity and affordability. I will work to create a deed restricted workforce housing solution with the housing authority and employers. I will work to guide our visitors with effective signage and alternative things to do when the park is full.

						As our tourism grows so should our quality of life for our residents. We need to make sure we have the necessary amenities that people look for when they decide where to live, work, retire and raise a family. We need places to gather as a community, we need community events planned for locals, we need places to park in the summer, we need solutions to the congestion during the peak season, and we need a variety of businesses and offerings to meet our needs.

We can leverage our advantages and our partnerships with other organizations in town to overcome the barriers to starting a business and to enhance our current businesses. We need data from business owners, visitors and residents to create a strategy to move forward.

                        We need to start planning not for the next tourist season but the next 20 years. We should be actively pursuing alternative forms of transportation and renewable energy. We need a bike lane downtown, more pedestrian friendly areas, and more winter activities, to name just a few. We have many stategic plans that offer visions of what could be, it is time to start making those a reality.

                        As our tourism continues to grow and the inconvenience to residents and visitors increases, we must manage parking to make the experience better for both. We need to think through the advantages of implementing paid parking downtown. It offers an opportunity to capitalize on our visitors to help maintain our town and invest back into our community.

                        I support vacation rentals because I know they are critical to our economy and the visitor experience. However, I believe there must also be an acceptable balance to the community. The management and regulation of vacation rentals in residential areas must be strictly enforced. We must do everything we can to minimize any impact to locals who live nearby vacation rentals.

                        <p>
                        There are developments in the near future to address affordable housing, so I want to ensure these are done well. I will push to include the public throughout the process by communicating well in advance. I want the town to create partnerships with businesses and the housing authority to create an effective system that ensures we are providing housing for people who work in our town.

                        I will do whatever I can to make sure we have the best floodplain map that is vetted and acceptable. The impacts to downtown could be substantial and I want to ensure the town board is doing what it can to ease the impact.

                        <p>
			The proposed fee increase to our park is not the optimal solution. However, I would like to see our community discuss the impacts of the park being full much of the year and the reality of a significant change to access the park in the near future. We must help drive forward a better visitor experience for both locals and guests.

			The number one priority should be redundancy, we need another fiber line connecting us outside our town to prevent another total outage. The second priority is both capacity and accessibility, we need to make sure we have enough bandwidth to support our current needs and any future growth, while also expanding access.

                        <p>
			In order for Estes Park to be a sustainable place for families we need to partner and work closely with the Family Advisory Board, EVICS, and the EDC childcare task force. We need to address the need for infant childcare immediately. The children are the future of Estes Park and we must do whatever we can to find a home for them.

                        <p>
			We need to prepare for the future and adopt the stormwater masterplan. This plan will provide sustainable drainage and flood mitigation solutions for both new and existing businesses and developments. However, before any action on funding is taken the public needs to understand what it is and how it will impact them. I will support exploring funding options as a utility is
only one way. I will also push to prioritize the highest impact upgrades and see if the town can fund these first.

                        <p>
						Thanks to the leadership of our Mayor, we have a capital improvement plan. This empowers the town board to prioritize the inevitable future upgrades to our infrastructure and provides the ability to set aside funds to address these as needed. Using this as a tool to continue to improve and maintain our town will be key.
